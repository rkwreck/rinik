## TTO Notes: Data Structures

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Linear vs Non-Linear Lists
* Linear list ex: for loops, enhanced for-loops
* Non-linear list accessed by keys

## Imperative vs Procedural vs OOP Programming

Note: Procedural is a type of imperative programming. Use flowchart diagrams bc they're more focused on procedure. Example:

### Procedural:
- removing repetitive blocks from sequence of code; bunch of functions put together
- enhancing imperative paradigm, improving its quality
- ex reusing code (loops, etc) 

### Imperative:
- keeping sequence of steps of the code 
- ex phone tree bc you're going off a sequence based on choice

### OOP:
- OOP knows some of your key properties and then solves your problem 
- Think like this: I have an object, this is how it interacts w/ the world
- use UML diagrams bc its more focused on properties. Example:

## Other Great Stuff to Know

### Arrays vs Hashmaps 
Arrays: 
- store primitive types, each index is an element --> non-linear 
Hashmaps:
- holds values in key-value pairs (the values of the keys could even be array) --> linear, direct access thru key

### Standardize
- means to simplify how things are executed so theres not 1M ways to execute something
